      Ruby on Rails -- also commonly referred to as Rails -- is a web application framework that works with the Ruby programming language. Although Ruby is a developer-friendly language, it wasn't designed for use on the Web. It has great functionality, but it's not userfacing. So how useful would it be to write in a language that only computers could process, and developers could run in terminal? ... Not very. That's where Rails comes into play. Ruby on Rials provides the framework to write a Ruby application and have it be part of an actual website.

      To get started with Rails, it's best to read through the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Documentation</a>. This is an open-source platform, meaning it is free to download and develop. The documentation walks through the process of installing rails for development, and walks through various parts of creating web apps with Rails. Similar to Ruby-Docs, the Rails Documentation walks through objects commonly used and helpful tips for starting up. The end goal is to be able to develop using Ruby on rails.

      With so many languages available, why choose Rails? Well, it's pretty popular and a powerful application. There are tons of sites that leverage the capabilities of Rails framework. Airbnb, Ask.fm, Basecamp, Bleacher Report, Bloomberg and many many more. All these sites explore Rails as a means of efficient building. They tap into the benefits of using Rails. As an open-source system, Rails is connected to an active web community. It's relatively easy to launch a working prototype, and quick launch means less expenses for companies. Using the framework is completely free.

      While looking into Rails, you're bound to come across discussions about the Ruby language. So, do you need to know Ruby to learn Rails? Not exactly... because you could pick up useful Ruby knowledge while building a foundation of Rails. At the same time, understanding Ruby will facilitate a smoother transition to using Rails.

     Essentially, Rails helps bring the language of Ruby to life. It allows developers to create webpages with HTML & CSS, then layer on additional capabilities provided through Ruby with the use of Rails. It's become a very popular language to learn and implemented by start-ups of all sizes.

    Rails is definitely something that I look forward to exploring in the future. Building with Ruby can only get you so far, as Rails helps bring the project to a functional website.
