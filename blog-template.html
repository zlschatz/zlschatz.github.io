Reflections Questions:
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I wouldn't say it was difficult, but it was a challenge to get into a good flow while creating the wireframe. We were both blank slates and didn't want to be pushing in the wrong direction. On a personal level, I prefer to sketch out ideas on paper but this would not have been an effective tactic given our remote locations. We ended up collaborating through a web app that Igor (my pair) had found.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes! Once we had our idea down, we both knew where the project was going. With the wireframe set, we were able to build the code together and create a solid template.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided to keep it basic. We wanted our wireframe to be a skeleton of our future site. This includes the basics of titles, image space and text.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
We refreshed on the <aside> tag. Igor also shared a cheatsheet with me that I had not seen in a previous module. We briefly discussed the table elements, but decided we needed more time to practice before implementing.
