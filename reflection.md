What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that borders can be very useful to determine space and see how elements are moving around the page. Even if a border will not be shown in the final product, they can be used as guides to position elements. I also realized that it is vital to understand the difference between the three properties to command positioning. They are all related to one another - but can essentially cancel each other out if not implemented correctly.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It is challenging. I found that many times I would manipulate multiple positioning properties, then realize I was not completing my intended task. I'd then have to retrace my steps to determine which property was causing the error. I found it best to constantly check whether the element's position was being adjusted correctly or just make revisions in the toolkit inspector to then be translated over to the css file. I also learned that positioning objects as relative will allow for easy manipulation through top, bottom, left and right properties. This will need to be changed in the future to create responsive websites -- I do not believe it is best practice to continuously implement relative positioning.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The header and footer seemed easiest from a design aspect - but overall I seem to feel kind of lost in it all. I'm not an expert designer, and I'm learning to write basic html pages. Keeping it basic allows me to work through the code - but it can also look pretty boring. I've tried to enhance the page with color, font and images, but I hope to change the layout / style as I become more comfortable writing the code.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

The more elements included in the HTML file, the more flexibility you have with CSS implementation. I found it best to go back and revise my HTML page to include additional elements and ids to distinguish styles for different parts of the site. Many times I would change a font style or positioning and then realize that multiple elements would be affected. It helps to understand nesting principles to see what will be affected when new CSS is being included.
