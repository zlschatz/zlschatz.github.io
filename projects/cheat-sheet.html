        <h2>GIT: HOW TO INSTALL</h2>
        <p>GitHub provides desktop clients that include a graphical user
        interface for the most common repository actions and an automatically
        updating command line edition of Git for advanced scenarios.</p>

        <h2>CSS: HOW TO POSITION ELEMENTS</h2>
        <p>CSS goes hand-in-hand with HTML5. This languages allows developers to design webpages, and manipulate content with color, font styles, positioning and more!</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Static Position</code></summary>
          <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Relative Position</code></summary>
          <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Fixed Position</code></summary>
          <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Absolute Position</code></summary>
          <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.</p>

        <h2>RUBY: MUST-KNOWS</h2>
        <p>A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Control Flow</code></summary>
          <p>Conditional statements using if, else, unless, etc. is the basis of Ruby blocks. Use comparison operators as the building blocks to construct your conditional statements. There are some simple ones that you should already be familiar with: ==, <, >, >=, and <=  != is "not equal".</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Loops & Iterators</code></summary>
          <p>Ruby can automate repetitive tasks for quick and easy returns. This includes 'while', 'until' and 'for' loops. Practice and review through <a href= "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby">Code Academy</a>.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Arrays & Hashes</code></summary>
          <p>Both are indexed collections used to store data. We tend to iterate over arrays/hashes to examine each data point and make an execution. Extended basic summary <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby.new_Arrays_and_Hashes.html">here</a>.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Methods, Blocks & Sorting</code></summary>
          <p>Methods are reusable code written to perform a specific task. This helps eliminate redundancies within your code. Methods can manipulate objects -- and there is no shortage of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Method.html">Ruby Methods</a>.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Symbols</code></summary>
          <p>They are generated using the :name and :"string" literals syntax, and by the various to_sym methods. The same Symbol object will be created for a given name or string for the duration of a program's execution, regardless of the context or meaning of that name.</p>

        <h2>RUBY: INTRO TO ENUMERABLES</h2>
        <p>Ruby's way of saying that we can get elements out of a collection, one at a time.</p>
        <p>Best to reference the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html">Ruby-Doc</a> as well.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>map/collect</code></summary>
          <p>Return a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enumerable.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>inject</code></summary>
          <p>Combines all elements of enum by applying a binary operation, specified by a block or a symbol that names a method or operator.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>grep</code></summary>
          <p>Returns an array of every element in enum for which Pattern === element. If the optional block is supplied, each matching element is passed to it, and the block’s result is stored in the output array.</p>

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, all values, except primitive values, are objects. Primitive values are: strings ("John Doe"), numbers (3.14), true, false, null, and undefined.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Object Properties</code></summary>
          <p>The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp">Link</a></p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Object Methods</code></summary>
          <p>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions. An object method is an object property containing a function definition. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp">Link</a></p>

        <h2>LOOPING: RUBY VS. JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p>Both languages utilize loops, but differ from one another.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Linguistic Differences</code></summary>
          <p>Both languages use object-oriented programming.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Syntax Differences</code></summary>
          <p>Variables, hashes, methods, for loops, and more are written differently. An additional difference is the inclusion of semi-colons in JavaScript, that is absent from Ruby.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><code>Usage Difference</code></summary>
          <p>Both are popular languages used within a majority of websites. Ruby is a bit newer, and JS currently has a larger impression on the web.</p>
