      Many languages - including Ruby - rely on the storage of data to execute user commands. These vast sets of data can be stored in either an array or a hash. Overall, each method of collecting information are used to store and retreive data. This can include numbers, words, phrases and more! However, there are a few differences that will lead you to choose one style over the other.

      In it's simplest form, you can think of an array as a list of data. The collection is stored within the array, and you are able to look up pieces of data in the set. Each piece of data (whether the value may be an integer or a string) is assigned a number in the list. The first value in the array is labeled as 0. The second value is labeled as 1. The third value as 2 - and this pattern continues. For example, if we have an array with 10 items in a grocery_list array, then we can call the fifth item with the following: grocery_list[4].
    </p>

      The second collector of data is known as a hash. Hashes are pairs of information retaining a key and a value. The key will stand in place of the name, and must be unique. The following is an example of a hash that translates the days of the week into spanish:
    </p>
    <p>
      dias = { "Monday" => "lunes", "Tuesday" => "martes", "Wednesday" => "mercoles" }
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, the key is "Monday" and the value is "lunes". This can be useful when data needs a key to trigger the returned value. To display the translation for Tuesday, you would call the hash like this: dias["Tuesday"].
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, hashes give you more flexibility to customize keys. Depending on the circumstance, either array or hash could be the best choice. The two have similar functions, as they both collect and store data.
