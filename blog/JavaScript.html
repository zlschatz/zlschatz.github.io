      This week marks my first steps into the world of JavaScript. Right off the bat, a common misconception was cleared up... JavaScript is NOT -- repeat, NOT -- the same thing as Java. These are two completely separate languages. At the time of JavaScripts birth, marketers wanted to capitalize on the popularity of Java. Unfortunately no one accounted for the fact that it would be terribly confusing moving forward. But that's, that! JavaScript is a powerful language that can manipulate objects in a similar manner to Ruby. We can define variables, use symbols, set up arrays & hashes, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the more prosperous opportunities that both Ruby and JavaScript withold is the power of loops. Loops are executed in order to repeat and action multiple times. For example, if we wanted to look at each item within a grocery list, we could set a loop to do so and find out whether 'apples' has already been included. Within both Ruby and JavaScript, purpose for loops can be similar but differ in syntax. Across both languages, we are able to use 'for' and 'while' loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      One major difference between the two languages is that JavaScript loops can act in a similar manner as Ruby iterations. The JavaScript 'for' loop can be implemented the same way that the Ruby '.each' method would be called for an iteration. In JavaScript, we write a for loop as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, the for loop (above) executes in a similar manner as the Ruby .each method. JavaScript for loops are given three statements. The first is executed before the loop begins. The second defines the condition that will end the loop. The third is done once the loop has completed and the block of code has been executed. In the example, we are counting up from 0 to 5, returing the text statement each time. If we wanted to do this through Ruby, we would rely on the .each method to implement a counter 0 to 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say we just wanted to print out a line multiple times. To do this, we can use for in both Ruby and JavaScript. The syntax would differ -- as they are separate languages -- but the main concept is the same. For will be the loop to take an argument, and this will be following by a block of code to be executed. Similar patterns can be seen for while loops as well!
